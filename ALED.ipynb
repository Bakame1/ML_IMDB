    "- Problem of datas that had different shape\n",
    "- Problem related to keras : in the function to fit the model, we are using sequential model and it says sequential has no outputs yet. Therefore, we tried to look for the issue on stackoverflow and github but we did not get response so we continued to debug it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps taken to alleviate difficulties\n",
    "To address the TorchText and Python version compatibility issue, we opted to use Kaggle to directly download the dataset and then import it into Pandas for preprocessing. This change in strategy allowed us to bypass the initial dependency from TorchText. For the challenge of data with varying shapes, I implemented data preprocessing techniques such as padding and truncation to normalize the input data, ensuring that all sequences were of equal length and suitable for model training. The website stack helped also while we were facing errors.\n",

    "#### General description of what you did, explain how you understood the task and what you did to solve it in general language, no code.\n",
    "For this task, we built a model that could classify the sentiment of individual words based on the sentiment of the sentences they appear in. To do so, we first prepared the data by tokenizing the text into words and sentences, and then padded the sentences to a uniform length to standardize the input for the model. Then, we developed a neural network model designed to process sequences of words and learn the contextual relationships that influence word sentiment. The model was trained on the IMDb dataset, using the sentence-level sentiment labels to teach it to classify words as positive, negative, or neutral. After training, the model was evaluated to assess its ability to accurately classify word sentiments in new sentences.\n",

    "#### Potential limitations of our approach, what could be issues, how could this be hard on different data or with slightly different conditions\n",
    "- **Data Bias**: The IMDb dataset may contain biases that could affect the model's performance on different types of data or under slightly different conditions.\n",
    "- **Context Length**: The model might struggle with longer contexts or sentences where the relationship between words and sentiment is more complex.\n",
    "- **Vocabulary Size**: Limitations in the model's vocabulary size could lead to misclassifications of words that are not well-represented in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Extensions and Future Work\n",
    "An interesting extension of this work could involve exploring different neural network architectures, such as transformers, which are known for their ability to handle long-range dependencies in text. Additionally, incorporating multimodal data, such as movie scenes or audio, could provide richer context for sentiment analysis. \n",
    "- This approach could also be extended to detect hate speech or discriminatory comments on social media platforms more effectively.\n",
    "- For hotel, restaurant and product that base their grade(with stars usuall) on the positive review.\n"
