    "# Contextual Word Sentiment Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a contextual word sentiment classification model using the IMDb dataset. \n",
    "The goal is to classify individual words as positive, negative, or neutral based on sentence-level sentiment labels, \n",
    "while incorporating the context of neighboring words.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: At the end you should write a report of adequate size, which will probably mean at least half a page. In the report you should describe how you approached the task. You should describe:\n",
    "- Encountered difficulties (due to the method, e.g. \"not enough training samples to converge\", not technical like \"I could not install a package over pip\")\n",
    "- Steps taken to alleviate difficulties\n",
    "- General description of what you did, explain how you understood the task and what you did to solve it in general language, no code.\n",
    "- Potential limitations of your approach, what could be issues, how could this be hard on different data or with slightly different conditions\n",
    "- If you have an idea how this could be extended in an interesting way, describe it.\n"
